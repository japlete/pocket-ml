# Pocket ML

Pocket ML is an AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) tool that runs entirely in the browser. It's designed to provide an easy way to prototype machine learning models without the need for setting up a developing environment, paying for server-side processing or worrying about data privacy issues.

## Current Status

This project is in early development. Current functionality includes:

- CSV file upload and parsing
- Basic data preprocessing
- Training a simple linear regression model
- Displaying basic model performance metrics (RMSE)
