# Pocket ML

Pocket ML is a tabular AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) tool that runs entirely in the browser. It's designed to provide an easy way to prototype machine learning models for tabular data without the need for setting up a developing environment, paying for server-side processing or worrying about data privacy issues.

## Current Status

This project is in early development. Current functionality includes:

- CSV file upload and parsing
- Basic data preprocessing (categorical feature encoding, missing value imputation, scaling)
- Training a regression or classification model
- Displaying basic model performance metrics (RMSE or accuracy)
